      <p>
        Best to practise straight after waking, directly after exercise, and
        just before sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practise in a calm, comfortable environment without distractions. If you
        feel dizzy, take a moment to rest after pracise. The vagus is a very
        large nerve, activating it repeatedly is relaxing, but also requires
        effort and might tire you out at first.
      </p>
      <p>Relax your muscles as you breath out.</p>
      <p>Try to 'will' the dot to slow down as you breath out.</p>
      <p>
        As you recognise the sensation of activating your vagus, practise its
        activation also without the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consistent daily practise over around one month is approximately the
        length of time needed to see developments in control of the vagus. Even
        short, minute long sessions, will have a strong cumulative effect if
        done daily.
