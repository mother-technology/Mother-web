This doesn't just mean vegetarian\n            lunches and taking the train instead of a flight, but in proactively\n            taking a environmentally conscious stance, and leading by example.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            We target the beneficial, working as much as possible with free and\n            open source software, privacy focused, with our intentions and actions\n            open and public.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Our interests.</h2>\n          <p>\n            We work with software tools like Unity, Blender, Meshroom, Meshlab and\n            R.
