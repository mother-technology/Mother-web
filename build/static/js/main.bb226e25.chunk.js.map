Consumers today hunger for companies that follow through on their word, act sincerely and with integrity, with a focus on sustainability and humanitarianism. We promise to never sacrifice these values.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n              We are also determined to act in a socially responsible way, to prioritise the needs and values of the societies we operate in, and to care proactively for the planet. This doesn't just mean vegetarian lunches and taking the train instead of a flight, but in proactively taking a environmentally conscious stance, and leading by example.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n              We target the beneficial, working as much as possible with free and open source software, privacy focused, with our intentions and actions open and public.\n              </p>\n              <h2>\n                Our interests.\n              </h2>\n              <p>\n                We work with software tools like Unity, Blender, Meshroom, Meshlab and R.
